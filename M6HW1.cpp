DIRECTIONS:
---------- 

*Bronze:*
Game should have at least three different rooms, which have exits between them. 
(Or, if you don't use rooms, at least three different "decision points" or actions.)

*Silver:*
Bronze, plus some dialog (either signs or NPCs) explaining what the 'point' of the 
game is, and some interaction (such as picking up items)

*Gold:*
Silver, plus the following:
Some kind of ending
At least one lock and key situation
For example, this means that a game where you have to find a key on one screen to 
open the door on a different screen to escape would count as Gold for full credit.

You could do this as finding a note one place that gives you the combination for a 
safe, or many other methods. Whatever fits with your game and your "foo"!
